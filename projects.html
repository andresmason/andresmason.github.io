	<!--Financial portfolio-->
	<button type="button" class="illustration collapsible">Finance Related Notes</button>
	<div class="content spaced">
		<ul>
			<li>In an attempt to diversify my assets while investing in a worthwhile cause, I am transferring some of my fixed income investments into either the purchase of part of an LLC or a small business loan to a coffee shop. Thought process:
				<ul>
					<li>Cafes are usually a terrible investment. However, this shop recently came under new ownership (has operated for years) and the owner's credit is too new to qualify for a small business loan from a bank. In the case of a loan, I would cash infuse the shop in exchange for an interest rate less than the average bank rate of 6%, which is still greater than a 9 month CD (usually returns ~3%). In the case of LLC share purchasing, I would split profits with the current owner, still yieling more than other fixed income assets. While it may not seem I would ever get my money back, as with a bond, the coffee shop owner wants to eventually turn the shop into one of the first consumer facing coop in Pennsylvania. To do this, they will have to either buy me out (I get my principal back), or they split the other owner's stake and I retain my "dividends".</li>
				</ul>
					<li>Recession investment strategy:
						<ul>
							<li>Dollar cost average monthly against SPY for every month it is below average gain of the past 5 years.</li>
							<li>Autoinvest into high divident yield mutual funds to create more steady fixed income to reinvest in more variable assets.</li>
							<li>A significant % of portfolio goes into fixed income assets like a treasury bond ladder or Series I bond to also create more fixed income.</li>
							<li>Thoughts for above: Aside from dollar cost averaging, even traditional safe areas for recession hedging (like precious metals) are becoming more volatile due to high inflation. Therefore, fixed income and low tech exposure are the answer. </li>
							<li>I'd also like to say I totally called the British pound tanking and their most recent prime minister failing as soon as she said Margaret Thatcher was an inspiration. I just couldn't get a loan in pound sterling fast enough to make use of it. Sad.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
			</li>
			<li>Am also considering starting a forex trading dataset through a club at CMU (to operate with CMU funding and use it for a polygon subscription). Thought process:
				<ul>
					<li>Prop shops can make successful, net positive trades/exchanges near instantly largely due to their datasets that analyze second by second market status. I seek to emulate a small facet of their business, and create a dataset for analyzing forex floating point exchange rates to execute positive currency exchanges. One large barrier of entry to doing this is the frequency I, as an individual, can query the market through Polygon's API or otherwise. Since services like these are so expensive, the clubs function would be to create the architecture for a worker owned base dataset. Once the dataset is laid out, we can pool money for a premium Polygon subscription and use our high call rate to fill our datatable. We would then use Tensorflow and numpy to create a model based off of it. I aim to collect 10 years of historical exchange rate data. Using this base set, individuals in the club will have access to it to use it for their personal algorithmic trading. Ideally, the club would also run the model once a day/week/etc. and then split profits among members, functioning as a coop.</li>
